## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 small shallot, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1–1.5 tbsp gochujang
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp hon mirin

3. Add soy sauce, water, mirin, maple syrup, vinegar. Combine.
4. Lower heat, stir in tahini until smooth.
5. Toss with cooked noodles, add noodle water to thin as needed.

- Finish with sesame oil, chili oil, fried shallots, scallions.
- Best with thick wheat noodles (knife cut, guan miao, or udon).
