## Ingredients

- 950ml water
- 1 piece kombu (dried kelp), about 10 × 10 cm
- 15g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), about 240ml loosely packed
- 70g miso paste (about 4 tbsp)
- 200g silken or medium-firm tofu, cut into 1.5 cm cubes
- 1 tbsp dried wakame seaweed
- 1 green onion, thinly sliced

## Method

### Make the dashi

1. Add 950ml water and the kombu to a saucepan. Soak for 30 minutes if you have time.
2. Heat slowly over medium-low (about 10 minutes). Never wash the kombu — the white residue is umami.
3. Just before it boils, remove the kombu and set aside.
4. Add the katsuobushi, bring to a boil, simmer 30 seconds, then turn off the heat.
5. Let the bonito flakes sink for 10 minutes, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve. You now have about 800ml awase dashi.

### Make the soup

6. Bring the dashi to a slow boil (about 96°C), then **turn off the heat**.
7. Dissolve the miso in a ladle or fine-mesh strainer — never add it directly to avoid clumps. Taste and adjust.
8. Add the tofu cubes gently (after dissolving the miso so they don't break).
9. Add the dried wakame and green onions right before serving to keep colour and fragrance.

## Tips

- **Shortcut:** Use 2–3 dashi packets steeped in 800ml hot water for 5 minutes instead of making dashi from scratch.
- **Ratio:** 1 tbsp (18g) miso per 200ml dashi. Adjust to taste.
- **Never boil** after adding miso — it kills the flavour and aroma.
- **Storage:** Best eaten fresh. Store without miso in the fridge up to 3–5 days; add miso per portion when reheating.
- **Reheating:** Warm gently, never boil. Stir in a little extra miso to refresh the aroma.
- Save spent kombu and katsuobushi for tsukudani or furikake.
