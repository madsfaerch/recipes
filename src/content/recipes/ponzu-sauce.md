## Ingredients

- 120ml soy sauce
- 120ml citrus juice (about 90ml lemon + 30ml orange)
- Zest from one lemon
- 30ml mirin (or substitute 2 tsp sugar + 30ml sake)
- 10g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), packed
- 1 piece kombu (dried kelp), 5 × 7.5 cm, 6g

## Method

1. In a sterilised mason jar, combine all ingredients. Mix well.
2. Steep in the refrigerator **overnight** (minimum), or up to one week for best flavour.
3. Strain through a sieve to remove the katsuobushi and kombu.
4. Transfer to a clean jar. Ready to use. Keeps refrigerated for up to 1 month.

## Usage

- **Dipping sauce** for shabu-shabu, gyoza, grilled fish, tataki
- **Dressing** for salads and cold noodles
- **Marinade** for grilled meats and vegetables

## Notes

- For the best flavour, steep for several days to a full week.
- If you can get yuzu, use it instead of lemon for authentic yuzu ponzu.
- Save the strained kombu and katsuobushi to make furikake.
- For vegan: omit katsuobushi, substitute 1–2 dried shiitake mushrooms.
