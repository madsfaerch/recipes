## Ingredients

- 600g eggplant (1–2 large)
- Salt
- Oil for deep-frying
- 1½ tbsp Sichuan chile bean paste (doubanjiang)
- 1½ tbsp finely chopped garlic
- 1 tbsp finely chopped ginger
- 150ml hot stock or water
- 4 tsp superfine sugar
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- ¾ tsp potato starch, mixed with 1 tbsp cold water
- 1 tbsp Chinkiang vinegar (Chinese black vinegar)
- 6 tbsp thinly sliced scallion greens

## Method

1. Cut the eggplant into batons, about 2 × 7cm. Sprinkle with salt, mix well, and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
2. Rinse the eggplant, drain well, and pat dry with paper towels. Heat deep-frying oil to about 200°C. Fry the eggplant in 2–3 batches, about 3 minutes per batch, until tender and lightly golden. Drain on paper towels.
3. Pour off all but 3 tbsp oil from the wok. Return to medium heat. Add the chile bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is red and fragrant — don't let it burn. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant.
4. Add the stock/water, sugar, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then gently add the eggplant. Simmer for 1–2 minutes to absorb the flavors.
5. Stir the potato starch mixture and add gradually in 2–3 stages — just enough to lightly thicken the sauce. Add the vinegar and scallion greens (reserve 1 tbsp), stir briefly.
6. Plate and scatter the remaining scallion greens on top.

## Notes

- Oven variant for larger batches: skip the frying. Toss salted, dried eggplant in a little oil and roast at 220°C for 15–20 minutes until golden. Pour the sauce over (without starch) and serve at room temperature.
