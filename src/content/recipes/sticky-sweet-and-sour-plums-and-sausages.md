## Ingredients

- 5 (750g) red onions, cut into 6 wedges
- 2 heads of garlic, skin on, each halved widthways
- 3 (750g) baking potatoes, skin on, each quartered lengthways
- 120ml olive oil
- 750g (about 10) red plums, halved and pitted
- 3 rosemary sprigs
- 8 pork sausages
- 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 90g pomegranate molasses
- 50g soft light brown sugar
- 2 tbsp sumac
- 10g picked parsley leaves, with some stem attached
- Salt and black pepper

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.
2. Put the onions, garlic, potatoes, 5 tablespoons of oil, 100ml of water, 1½ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper into a large roasting tin (roughly 40cm × 30cm). Toss everything together, then bake for **35 minutes**, stirring halfway through, until the vegetables have softened and started to colour and the water has evaporated.
3. Add the plums (cut side up) and the rosemary, then nestle in the sausages. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar, molasses, sugar, 2 tablespoons of water, 1½ tablespoons of sumac, 2 tablespoons of oil, ½ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour this all over the mixture in the tin. Return to the oven for **40 minutes**, carefully turning over the sausages halfway through.
4. Turn the oven temperature up to 200°C fan and roast for **10 minutes** more, or until everything is nicely browned, the plums have broken down and the sauce is bubbling and sticky.
5. Toss together the parsley, the remaining 1½ teaspoons of sumac and the remaining tablespoon of oil. Dot this all over the sausage mixture. Serve warm, directly from the tray.
