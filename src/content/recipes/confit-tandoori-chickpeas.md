## Ingredients

- 2 tins chickpeas (800g), drained
- 11 garlic cloves, peeled — 10 whole, 1 crushed
- 30g fresh ginger, julienned
- 400g cherry tomatoes
- 3 red chillies, slit lengthwise
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed
- 2 tsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ½ tsp chilli flakes
- 2 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 200ml olive oil
- Salt

### Herb Yoghurt

- 180g Greek yoghurt
- 15g mint leaves
- 30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1 crushed garlic clove (from above)
- Lime wedges to serve

## Method

1. Oven at 150°C fan.
2. Combine chickpeas, whole garlic, ginger, tomatoes, chillies, tomato paste, all spices, sugar, oil, 1 tsp salt in a lidded sauté pan.
3. Cover, oven for **2–3 hours**, stirring occasionally. (Original says 75 min but longer is better — chickpeas get super soft.)
4. Blitz yoghurt, mint, coriander, lime juice, crushed garlic, ¼ tsp salt.
5. Serve from the pan with herb yoghurt and lime wedges.

## Notes

- Can be made ahead — improves with time.
- Use dairy-free yoghurt for vegan.
- Serve with rice.
