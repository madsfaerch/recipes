## Ingredients

- 120ml sake
- 275ml mirin
- 250ml soy sauce
- 1 piece kombu (dried kelp), 5 × 5 cm, 5g
- 10g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes), packed

## Method

1. In a saucepan, combine the sake, mirin, and soy sauce.
2. Add the kombu and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. Once boiling, remove the kombu. Add the katsuobushi.
4. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
5. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the bonito flakes. Let cool completely.
6. Transfer to a clean jar and refrigerate. Keeps for up to 1 month.

## Usage

This is a **concentrated** (2× strength) mentsuyu. Dilute before using:

- **Cold dipping sauce (tsuketsuyu):** 1 part mentsuyu : 1 part cold water
- **Hot noodle soup (kaketsuyu):** 1 part mentsuyu : 3–4 parts hot water
- **Tempura dipping sauce:** Use straight or 1:1 with water

## Notes

- For vegetarian/vegan: omit katsuobushi, substitute 2 dried shiitake mushrooms.
- Save the strained kombu and bonito flakes to make furikake (rice seasoning).
