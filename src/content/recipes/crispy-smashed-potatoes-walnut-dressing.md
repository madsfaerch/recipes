## Ingredients

- 450g baby Dutch yellow potatoes
- 60g kosher salt (for boiling water), plus more to taste
- 60ml olive oil, divided
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 30g walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1 anchovy fillet in oil, removed from oil
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 20g golden raisins
- 2 tsp Aleppo pepper
- 90g sour cream
- 15g fresh herbs, roughly chopped (dill and parsley work well)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 230°C.
2. Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water by 8cm. Add salt, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to medium-low, simmer until easily pierced with a knife, 10–15 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.
3. Place potatoes ~8cm apart on a baking sheet. Gently smash each with the heel of your hand to about 1cm thickness.
4. Brush with 30ml olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Bake, rotating sheet halfway through, until lightly browned and crispy, 30–35 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, combine walnuts, anchovy, and remaining 30ml olive oil in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until walnuts are lightly browned, ~6 minutes. Remove from heat, add garlic, raisins, and Aleppo pepper. Stir to combine. Season with salt.
7. Spread sour cream on a serving platter, top with smashed potatoes, drizzle with walnut dressing, and finish with herbs.

## Notes

- The walnut-anchovy dressing is an umami bomb — walnuts, anchovies, garlic, and Aleppo pepper.
- Aleppo pepper is milder than regular red pepper flakes; use less if substituting.
- Can be served as starter, snack, or side.
